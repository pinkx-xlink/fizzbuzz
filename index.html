    <h1>How FizzBuzz Works:</h1>
    <p>"Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and 
        prints the numbers from one to the number the user 
        entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz 
        instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
        For numbers which are multiples of both 
        three and five print FizzBuzz."</p>

<script>
    // take input from user 
    // print numbers up to that number 
    // print fizz for multiples of 3
    // print buzz for mult of 5
    // print fizzbuzz for mult of 3 and 5
